# CNN Training Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook, which outlines the training process of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. This tutorial is specifically designed for the EMNIST (Extended MNIST) dataset. 

## Dataset 

You can download the EMNIST dataset from the following URL: [EMNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist).

## Requirements

- PyTorch: For creating and training the CNN.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive model building and training.
